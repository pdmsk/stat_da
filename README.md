# Homework Assignments — Statistical Data Analysis Course  
Harbour.Space University | Jan 2024  
Lecturer: Evgeniy Riabenko

## Overview

This repository contains three homework assignments completed as part of the **Statistical Data Analysis** course, held from January 8 to January 25, 2024. The course focused on statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, regression, and time series forecasting.

## 📄 Assignment 2 — Statistical Hypothesis Testing  
**Task:**  
Find the best statistical method to determine if average protein expression levels differ between healthy and trisomy mice across experimental subgroups.  
**Dataset:**  
Expression levels of 77 proteins measured in 1080 samples of mouse cerebral cortex, including information on health status, memantine treatment, and learning stimulation.  
**Goal:**  
Choose an appropriate statistical method, justify its application, report the results (p-value, effect size point and interval estimates), and formulate a client-friendly conclusion.

## 📄 Assignment 3 — Regression Analysis  
**Task:**  
Analyze seismic activity data using regression to predict the probability of a dangerous seismic shock (>10⁴ Joules) occurring within the next 8-hour shift.  
**Dataset:**  
`seismic.xlsx` — Data collected from seismic activity monitoring in Polish coal mines.  
**Goal:**  
Build a predictive model, interpret the regression coefficients, and evaluate feature importance.

## 📄 Assignment 4 — Time Series Forecasting  
**Task:**  
Select and analyze a time series, forecast approximately 10% into the future, and present results following course requirements.  
**Dataset:**  
Daily minimum and maximum temperatures recorded in Australia.  
**Goal:**  
Perform exploratory analysis, build an appropriate time series model, and forecast future values.
